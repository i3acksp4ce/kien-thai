# Session checkpoint — 2026-05-19

Wraps up the autonomous session that started 2026-05-13 (continuation
of the chrome-vetting work). Session ended cleanly — all in-flight
work committed; no uncommitted state.

## What was done

1. **Committed prior chrome-vetting work** (`019c29e`,
   `kien-thai: browser-vetting pass — ๆ-spacing rule, register cleanup`):
   - `style-rules.md` — new `mai-yamok-spacing` entry (`ต่าง ๆ`
     always spaced; other reduplications register-scoped).
   - `register.md` — Fictionlog/Tunwalai moved to dropped-sources;
     Minimore citation added.
   - `research-queue.md` — resolved 2 entries, reframed 1
     (animacy → register-leak).
   - New `notes/chrome-session-2026-05-13.md` documenting the
     browser-vetting evidence.

2. **Wrote proposals note** (`2fbb2e1`,
   `notes: skill-change proposals from 2026-05-13 chrome-session
   follow-up`):
   - `notes/proposals-2026-05-13.md` — three items: Proposal A
     (`register-leak-emotional-verb` rule for `register.md`,
     deferred until iter-8+ recurrence with full landing-ready
     draft text); Proposal B (sharpen `CLAUDE.md` iteration
     discipline §3.5 on the register-vs-universal axis); defer
     for `mai-yamok-spacing` examples in `examples.md`.
   - `research-queue.md` reframed entry now cross-references the
     proposal note so the draft text is findable.

3. **School-import scope** — surveyed delta this-repo vs school
   clone (`/Users/chakrit/.local/share/ace/prod9/school`):
   4 commits since last import (2026-05-10), 471+/139− across
   7 kien-thai files + 5+/6− in kode-thai SKILL.md. Presented full
   diff for chakrit review. Chakrit declined autonomous school sync:
   `"Edit in this repo, i'll handle my own school updates, thanks."`
   Saved as durable preference in user MEMORY
   (`feedback_school_sync_self_handled.md`).

## What's next

- **Chakrit reviews** `notes/proposals-2026-05-13.md` to decide if
  Proposals A and B should land. Proposal B has no gating
  requirement; Proposal A waits for iter-8+ recurrence (or a
  retroactive 2nd instance in the unreviewed iter-7 codex/baseline
  outputs).
- **Iter-7 unreviewed outputs** — 10 outputs from
  `workspace/iteration-7/` (codex backends, baselines, news-feature-
  bts both backends) remain un-reviewed per
  `workspace/iteration-7/feedback.md` § Followups. A pass for
  `ทน*`/`เครียด`/`ทรมาน` on system subjects would settle Proposal A.
- **School sync** — chakrit handles upstream propagation of the
  current kien-thai/kode-thai state when ready.

## Open questions

- Whether to lift `mai-yamok-spacing` exemplars into
  `examples.md` proactively (currently deferred; see proposals note
  for rationale).
- Whether to apply Proposal B (CLAUDE.md iteration discipline tweak)
  on its own — it has no gating-evidence requirement.

## State at checkpoint

- Working tree: clean.
- Branch: `main`, in sync with `gh/main`.
- Recent commits: `2fbb2e1`, `019c29e`, `d806430` (all this session
  or its immediate predecessor).
- TaskList: empty — all in-flight tasks completed or deleted.

Safe to `/clear`.
