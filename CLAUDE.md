# PRODIGY9 Coding School

This project's AI coding environment is managed by [ACE](https://github.com/ace-rs/ace).
Run `ace` to start a coding session. Run `ace setup` if not yet configured.

## Two skill sources — keep them straight

This repo sits at the intersection of **two** skill bodies. They serve opposite
roles and must not be confused.

**1. School skills — authoritative; apply them.** General coding/workflow skills
from the **PRODIGY9 Coding School**, symlinked into `.claude/skills/` from
`~/.local/share/ace/prod9/school/skills/`. These govern *how Claude edits this
repo*: file editing, shell discipline, markdown style, eval harness work, ACE
workflow, school-PR flow. Edits flow back to the school clone through the
symlinks — propose changes back when ready. Run `ace config` / `ace paths` to
debug configuration. See "Load these skills" below for the active set.

**2. `skills/kien-thai/` + `skills/kode-thai/` — artifact under development;
NOT authority.** These two skills live in this repo and **this repo is their
source-of-truth** (the school re-imports from here, not the other way around).
Their target is Thai prose that (1) reads as little like generic AI output as
possible, (2) has a distinct, believably human voice, (3) is easy to read for
native Thai readers, (4) counters training-data skew toward over-formal /
over-polite Thai. Composition: `kien-thai` = content rules (7 frames + ai-tells
+ grammar + craft + style-rules + register + examples + forbidden-phrases);
`kode-thai` = audit-loop trigger that invokes kien-thai to convergence. They
are the **work-in-progress being tested** — do **not** self-apply them to
Claude's own Thai output. Their correctness is what evals measure; freelance
application contaminates the signal. The harness injects them under controlled
conditions; outside the harness they are content under review, edited through
the iteration discipline below.

### Locked decisions — skill content

- No celebrity-columnist source material. Tech writing, bank long-form
  (non-sensational), younger newspaper voices, internationally-minded
  translators.
- No LLM-judge until human review proves insufficient.

## 🚨 Iteration discipline — READ FIRST 🚨

> **Rules don't get added on vibes. Trace before you write.**
>
> Every rule in `skills/kien-thai/` was synthesized from research into specific Thai
> writing sources (real tech blogs, bank long-form, young-newspaper features, skilled
> non-fiction translation). Each rule has a *why* — a failure mode it counters or a
> human-writing pattern it captures.
>
> **Rules without provenance rot. Don't grow the skill faster than the evidence does.**

When an eval output looks bad, the temptation is to immediately add a new rule or
tighten an existing one. **Resist this.** Trace first:

1. **Find the offending pattern** in the output.
2. **Map it to existing rules** — which rule was supposed to prevent this? Is it in
   `ai-tells.md` (mechanical), `craft.md` (soft), `grammar.md` (surface),
   `style-rules.md`, `register.md`, or `examples.md`? If it's in none, that's a real
   gap.
3. **If a rule exists but didn't fire**: ask why. Was it buried? Phrased weakly?
   Conflicting with another rule? Wrong register applied? Fix the existing rule's
   wording, prominence, or anchoring example — don't pile on a new rule that says
   the same thing differently.
4. **If no rule covers it**: before adding one, check the source-research evidence.
   Is this a pattern the research surfaced? If yes, surface the existing observation
   into a rule. If no, the new rule is speculative — flag it as such, add only with
   a concrete citation or counter-example, and keep it provisional.
5. **Document the trace** in `iteration-N/feedback.md` so the rule's origin survives.

External contributors follow the same logic via [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)
— that's the public-facing version of this section.

> **Workspace outputs are evidence, not artifacts.** Eval outputs under
> `workspace/iteration-N/<eval>/<backend>/<config>/` (`output.md`, `pass-N.md`,
> prompts, meta) are gitignored generation evidence — what the model produced under
> the current skill bundle. Read them to derive rules, register-tagged exemplars,
> and judgements. **Do not edit them.** The "find a bug, fix the file" reflex from
> normal coding work does not apply here: the bug is in the model's behavior, the
> fix is in the skill content. Edits to gitignored outputs vanish on the next
> regeneration and produce nothing durable.
>
> The tracked, durable artifacts are: `skills/kien-thai/references/*.md` (rules),
> `references/examples.md` (before/after exemplars), `notes/judgements/`
> (retrospective calls), and `workspace/iteration-N/feedback.md` (per-iteration
> trace — note: feedback files at the iteration root are tracked; only the eval
> subdirectories are ignored). When a corrected version of an output line teaches a
> generalizable pattern, lift it into `references/examples.md` with the trace — that
> is where "before → after" content lives durably.

> **1-by-1 review protocol.** When chakrit invokes "1-by-1" on a stretch of review
> work, discuss each item to resolution one at a time and **log agreed edits to a
> task batch** as decisions are reached. Do not apply edits mid-discussion. Actual
> work — file edits, skill additions, commits — starts only after all items in the
> queue have been discussed. The point is to keep the discussion thread coherent
> without context-switching into file edits between items. Confusing 1-by-1 with
> propose-then-wait (which permits per-item apply on approval) is a recurring
> failure mode; under 1-by-1, even approved items get queued, not applied.

## Authoring the skill

Everything below is about *how we build and iterate the skill*, not about Thai prose
itself.

```

### Eval strategy

Two-stage, per skill-creator doctrine — subjective prose is judged by humans, not
assertions.

- **Stage 1 (generate)**: `pytest -m generate` invokes
  `claude --disable-slash-commands --output-format json -p` and `codex exec --json`.
  Skill is injected via prompt prepend (only diff between with_skill and baseline).
  Bundle is register-scoped via `kien_thai_bundle(register, mode)` and uses
  two-tier injection — pass-0 ('draft' mode) keeps workflow sections; audit
  and fix passes share the same 'audit' bundle with workflow sections dropped.
  Outputs land in
  `iteration-N/<eval>/<backend>/<config>/{output.md,prompt.txt,meta.json}`.
  meta.json tracks per-pass usage (cache hits, input/output tokens).
- **Stage 2 (review)**: human + Claude review artifacts inline in the chat. No browser
  viewer (yet). Cross-check across backends to mitigate self-judge bias. Consolidated
  notes go to `iteration-N/feedback.md` and graduate into `references/*.md`.
- **`test_quant.py`** is advisory only — flags forbidden phrases and connective
  density. Not a quality gate.

### Commands

```
uv sync                                  # one-time deps
uv run pytest                            # sanity (fast, default)
uv run pytest -m generate                # produce artifacts (slow, $$$)
uv run pytest -m generate -n 4 -k claude # parallel, one backend
uv run pytest -m evaluate                # advisory heuristics on latest iteration
```

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `codex` logged in. Tests skip gracefully if a backend
is missing.

### Locked decisions — tooling

- Backends: claude + codex, both in bare modes (no skill auto-loading), JSON
  output for usage telemetry.
- Skill injection: register-scoped bundle prepended under `<skill>...</skill>`.
  Source files keep verbose form (consistency test parses them); preprocessor
  in `tests/lib.py:kien_thai_bundle` strips frontmatter, dead refs, default
  metadata, and filters by register at bundle time.
- Two-tier injection: pass-0 (draft) → full register-scoped bundle. Audit
  and fix passes → drop draft-time workflow sections (audit-mode bundle).
  **Fix passes always run with the full register-scoped audit bundle —
  never a slimmed cited-rules-only variant.** Tried in iter-6 and rejected:
  per-pass slimming strips sibling-rule context and the fixer thrashes,
  introducing new violations as fast as it patches cited ones. Iteration
  is tested with the full ruleset applied; do not re-attempt slimming.
- Python: 3.13+ via `uv`. pytest 9 + pytest-xdist.

## Cached native-Thai corpus

`corpus/` holds vetted native-Thai source material — **this is the canonical
source for every rule and every exemplar in `skills/kien-thai/`.** Do not
fabricate Thai prose, do not lift Claude-authored output from
`workspace/iteration-N/...` or from the After-blocks in `references/examples.md`
when you need a native-voice anchor. Pull from here instead.

```
corpus/
├── README.md                # category map (saas-sme, b2b-formal, tech-writing,
│                            #   bank-longform, newspaper-feature, translation,
│                            #   scholarly, etc.)
├── curated/<category>/*.md  # 1–4 paragraph hand-picked snippets, with
│                            #   frontmatter (source_url, retrieved, voice notes)
└── raw/<category>/*.md      # full article body retained for deeper analysis
```

When pulling excerpts for `references/exemplars.md` or rule provenance, keep
them **short** (fair-use sized) and cite the corpus file path in an HTML
comment above the block.

Gaps (registers with no curated entry yet) are tracked in
`notes/source-vetting-2026-05-13.md` and the work-queue. If a register has no
corpus file, surface that — don't paper over it with synthesized prose.

## Markdown style for this repo

All Markdown files in this repo follow these rules. Durable here so open-source
contributors follow them without needing the school skill.

**Hard-wrap at column 90.** Wrap every line at 90 columns. Break before the limit,
never after. Apply to prose, bullet items, and blockquotes. Do not wrap inside fenced
code blocks, tables, or URLs.

Indent bullet continuations under the first character after the marker:

```markdown
- A long bullet item that exceeds ninety characters must wrap cleanly at the limit,
  with the second line aligned under the first letter of the bullet text.
```

Practical exemptions — treat as atomic, like URLs:

- YAML frontmatter (`description:` fields stay single-line).
- Long Thai sentences inside inline backticks or blockquotes — splitting mid-string
  breaks rendering.
- Verbatim source quotes (English originals for translation examples, etc.).

**Align table columns.** Pad cells with spaces so pipes line up vertically. Size the
separator dashes to the widest cell in each column. Match padding direction to
alignment: left-aligned and default columns pad right; right-aligned columns pad left;
centered columns pad both sides. Apply to header cells too — a right-aligned column
gets a right-aligned header.

```markdown
| Name  | Role                  |  Yrs |
| ----- | --------------------- | ---: |
| Alice | Engineer              |    4 |
| Bob   | Senior Staff Engineer | 1024 |
```

Repad the whole column whenever any cell in it changes width.

## Load these skills

School skills only (per "Two skill sources" above) — narrows ACE auto-load:

- `general-coding` — Python edits in `tests/`, eval harness work.
- `markdown-writing` — primary deliverables are Markdown (`SKILL.md`,
  `references/*.md`, eval feedback). Hard-wrap-90 + table-align rules apply.
- `skill-creator` — this repo *is* a skill (the kien-thai/kode-thai artifact);
  iteration follows skill-creator doctrine (two-stage evals, human review).
- `shell` — `uv` / pytest / eval harness shell glue.
- `ace`, `ace-audit`, `ace-docs`, `ace-realign`, `ace-save`, `ace-school` —
  ACE workflow + school-PR flow.

## Opening files for review or markdown editing

Terminal pagers (`less`, `bat`, `cat`) mangle Thai rendering — combining marks
misalign, line-breaks split syllables. When chakrit says "open X for review",
"open X in a markdown editor", or anything similar that calls for human-readable
display or hand-editing of a markdown file, hand it off to **iA Writer**:

```
open -a 'iA Writer' <filename>
```

Default to this for any Thai-prose target — eval outputs under
`workspace/iteration-N/...`, `references/*.md`, `notes/judgements/*`,
`skills/kien-thai/**/*.md`, etc. — and for any "open in markdown editor" /
"open the markdown" request regardless of Thai content.

Check availability with `ls /Applications/'iA Writer.app'` if uncertain;
fallback to terminal display only when iA Writer is missing.

## RTK (token saver)

Prefix every shell command with `rtk`. Full reference: [`RTK.md`](RTK.md).
